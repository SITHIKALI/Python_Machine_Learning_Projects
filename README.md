# Machine Learning Projects

## Project 1: Sales Prediction from Existing Customer Data - Logistic Regression
      Linear Regression is a statistical method for predicting binary outcomes from data. In this project, we will use logistic regression to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on their existing data.
## Project 2: Salary estimation using K-NEAREST NEIGHBOUR
      K-Nearest Neighbor is a simple yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. Your notebook uses it for classification (predicting salary categories).

## Project 3:
